 HOW TO PLAY

                                                                       MOVEMENT

Basic movement is to move a checker one space diagonally forward.You can not move a checker
backwards until it becomes a Queen,as described below. If a jump is available, you must take the jump,
as described in the next question and answer.

                                                                      JUMPING

If one of your opponent’s checkers is on a forward diagonal next to one of your checkers, and the next 
space beyond the opponent’s checker is empty, then your checker must jump the opponent’s checker 
and land in the space beyond.  Your opponent’s checker is captured and removed from the board. 

                                                       YOU MUST JUMP IF POSSIBLE

If a jump is available for one of your pieces, you must make that jump. If more jumps are available with
 that same piece, you must continue to jump with it until it can jump no more. To make the second and 
third jump with a piece, you do not need to click that piece again. Just click the next space to which it will jump. 

If more than one of your pieces has a jump available at the start of your turn, you can
 choose which piece you will move. But then you must make all the jumps available for that piece. 

                                                                    CROWNING

When one of your checkers reaches the opposite side of the board, it is crowned and becomes a King. 
Your turn ends there. A Queen can move backward as well as forward along the diagonals. 
It can only move a distance of one space. A Queen can also jump backward and forward. .
